    "description":"Within Firdawsi's Shahnama, one important story is \"Faridun Tests His Sons\". In the Bodleian Library, this scene is represented as folio number 32b. The Shahnama is the book of kings and this story follows when Faridun transforms into a dragon. By turning into a dragon, it enables him to test his sons personally which then allows him to uncover each of hissons’s characters so that he may name them accordingly. Many different aspects of the illustration are important when analyzing this folio as they can explain what an illustrator or patron may have wanted to portray or give a sense of what emotions could be included in the story. Within the illumination of this scene, 6 details will be analyzed and discussed. Each detail no matter how small and insignificant has a purpose that enables the reader to learn quite a lot. The elements that will be looked at ar, the dragon's hair, the dragon's eyes, the bushes, the first son, the 2 other sons, and finally the fire. These details not only tell us about the story, but also allow the reader to understand the story in more depth. In the world literature context, the Shahnama is very important because it not only has many exciting and interesting stories that the author's students have enjoyed engaging with, but it also recounts Persian history (Lewis, 2015, 317)."},

    "description":"Firstly, the dragon’s hair and body color must be addressed. As in the story, the dragon is Faridun. He has disguised himself as a dragon so that he is able to test his 3 sons personally. When looking at what appears to be hair on the top of the dragon's head, it can be established that it is white in colour. Now one possibility as to why the illustrator would have coloured it white would be to represent age. By having a dragon with hair such as this, historians can determine that it mimics the age of the transformer. Faridun would have been aged with 3 adult sons. Additionally, the colour of the overall dragon is grey. This is a great way to give an ominous look. As the dragon in its neutral colour contrasts with the vibrant background, this gives the effect that he is menacing. Grey is often the colour used to convey a message with dread and a dragon attack is certainly a dreadful event. It is also a great way to contrast the peaceful coloured background. By having the background as colourful, it conveys a happy tone but with the grey of the dragon it allows the readers to understand that for Faridun it is an exciting day because he can test his sons, however, to his sons, it is dreadful because they are coming face to face with a monstrous dragon."},

    "description":"Another aspect of the dragon that is interesting is its eyes. If a reader or scholar looks at the detail of the eyes, the dragon does not convey any looks of anger or hostility. This of course gives the effect that in truth, the dragon is not there to hurt any of the sons. This would make sense as Faridun is not looking to hurt his sons, rather he simply wants to test them in hopes that he can name them determined by their character. The art of the folio is not overall complicated, so it is interesting that the dragon's eyes are able to portray the look of emotions. It is said that Faridun would later divide his kingdom between all 3 men which offers the reader context about how he regarded his sons because he entrusted his lands to each of them (Encyclopaedia Iranica Foundation). This is another marker explaining that he indeed only wished to test them and possibly to also witness if they would be fit to rule. If the sons were to look into the eyes, they would be able to tell that this dragon meant them no harm. The eyes also seem to look human. This would be a way to show the human within the monster. It can also convey a message that Faridun had full control over his monstrous form."},

    "description":"Diverting our attention to what is around Faridun. When looking at the bushes that the dragon is drawn in, it gives the effect that Faridun has hidden in the bushes and waited to reveal himself. This could also be used as cover while he transformed so that his sons would not know it was him. The bushes, like the rest of the scenery, and the 3 sons beautifully contrast with the grey dragon. As explained before, this could be largely since contrasting the dragon gives off a sense that the dragon is ominous and does not fit in with everything around it. By having the bushes, a nice pink colour, they match the surrounding scenery which all together portrays a peaceful and joyful environment. As explained earlier, in the context of the story, this would be a joyful time for Faridun because he is getting the chance to understand all his sons further. For Faridun the bushes may also be a form of protection because he is able to hide if need be. The colour of the bushes could also simply be a way to better contrast the colour of the dragon as well. By contrasting the grey and the pink bushes, the grey will stand out more and more easily conveying a daunting tone."},

    "description":"Next, it is very important to analyze the second son. In the translated Shahnama, the second announces with arms ready, “When fight is toward, what matter if the foe be roaring lion or brave cavalier?” (Firdawsi, 1905, 187-8). He is the son that is brave as a lion which earns him the name Tur. When looking at the illumination the son is armed and ready to attack the dragon. With this stature, a reader can determine that indeed, this would have to be the first son because he is the only one to take up defense. It is also important to note that he is the only son that is in the full frame of the illumination. This is very interesting because why could the other sons not be painted into the scene fully as well? This gives the effect that the illuminator’s goal may not have been to include many different scenes into one. This could also mean that he was not as concerned with time either because it is possible to include a combination of different times in the same story as can be seen in the Shah Tahmasp's Shahnama in the Simurgh and Zal story."},

    "description":"Concerning the other 2 sons that are more or less off-frame, it gives the effect that the illumination was not completely finished. Sims explains that depending on the patron of different versions illustrative differences appear which is due to each patron wanting to say something different (1992, 49). The background for the 2 is simply brown which further makes it seem like the illumination was not completed. However, this could also mean that the illuminator only wanted to highlight the second son for his bravery. This could be due to the fact that, as said in one of the sections above, he did not want or like to include many different parts of a story in one image therefore highlighting only 1 son is easier. Nevertheless, the effect is that the 2 brothers are less important than the oldest. In the story, these sons earn the name Salm and Iraj. Iraj, the youngest of the 3 was the one to take up negotiations with the dragon more or less and Salm is the one not to shy away from fleeing when he does not believe that he can win. Nevertheless, each son is as important as the next."},

    "description":"The last detail that I will talk about is the fire in the dead center of the illumination. This fire is quite interesting due to its placement, colour, and its size. Being right in the middle can often mean that it should be an element that readers should pay attention to. The importance is also represented by the colour. The colour that was chosen is gold which historically is used to signify something of great importance. However, the size is quite small. In fact, with the combination of size and colour it can be very easy to miss. This is a choice that the illuminator may have made to convey the message that Faridun would never want to hurt his sons but does want to give them a challenge. By spouting fire, he is asserting that he is a danger, but he does it in a way that is small enough so that if it did for some reason come in contact with any of his beloved sons, it would be less likely to injure them. It is also small enough that, if need be, the sons would be able to dodge the oncoming attack."},
