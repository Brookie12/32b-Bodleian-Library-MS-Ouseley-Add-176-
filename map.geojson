    "description":"Within Firdawsi's Shahnama, one important story is \"Faridun Tests His Sons\". In the Bodleian Library this scene is represented in folio number 32b. The Shahnama is the ancient Persian Book of Kings and this specific scene follows when Faridun transforms into a dragon. Turning into a dragon enables him to test his sons personally which then allows him to uncover the character of each of his sons so that he may name them accordingly. It is very interesting when we can get a sense of what authors are thinking. This is why taking a closer look at the many different details of this illustration are important when analyzing this folio. They not only give us an inside scoop of what the illustrator or author is wanting to portray in every eye detail to every colour. Within the depiction of this scene, six details are going to be analyzed and discussed to demonstrate just how powerful details can be to a story. Each and every detail no matter how small and insignificant has a purpose that enables our classmates and other curious readers to learn quite a lot. The elements that will be looked at are, the dragon's hair, the dragon's eyes, the bushes, the second son, the two other sons, and finally the fire. These details not only tell us about the story, but also allow us and others to understand the story in more depth. It is alos importat to not that in the world literature context, the Shahnama is very important because it not only has many exciting and interesting stories that students have enjoyed engaging with, but it also recounts Persian history (Lewis, 2015, 317). Therefore, this ancient Persian book is not only a source of history and learning, but it is one that engages readers of all ages espcially due to its colourful painted nature. Who does not like brightfully colour books and stories?"},

    "description":"First off, the dragon’s hair and body color is a very interesting detail that deserves a closer look. As what is said in the story, the dragon is Faridun. He has disguised himself so that he is able to test his three sons personally. When looking at what appears to be hair on the top of the dragon's head, it can be established that it is white in colour which could be to represent his age. Faridun would have been aged with three adult sons which further supports the assumption that the hair colour is highly liklely due to his age. Additionally, the colour of the overall dragon is grey. This is a great way to give an ominous look to a rather colourful background. As the dragon in its neutral colour contrasts with the vibrant background, this gives the effect that he is menacing. Grey is often the colour used to convey a message with dread and a dragon attack is certainly a dreadful event. It is also a great way to contrast the peacefully coloured background which also sets the tone of the painting. By having the background as colourful as it is, the illustration conveys a happy tone but with the grey of the dragon it allows the readers to imagine that for Faridun it is an exciting day because he can test his sons. However, to his sons, it is dreadful because they are coming face to face with a monstrous dragon. If the illuminator only painted in similar colours, no contrast would be possible. Therefore, us readers would have no clue what the tone of the scene may be."},

    "description":"The dragon's eyes are particularly interesting meriting a deeper dive into their meaning. The dragon does not bear any looks of anger or hostility which conveys that the dragon is not there to hurt any of the sons. This would make sense as Faridun is not looking to hurt his sons. Rather he simply wants to test them so that he can name them according to their character. The art of the folio is not overall complicated, so it is interesting that the dragon's eyes are able to portray the look of emotions. It is said that Faridun would later divide his kingdom between all 3 men which offers the reader context about how he regarded his sons because he entrusted his lands to each of them (Ahmad, 1999). This is another detail explaining that he indeed only wished to test them and possibly to also witness if they would be fit to rule. If the sons were to look into the eyes, they would be able to tell that this dragon meant them no harm. The eyes also seem to look human. This would be a way to show the human within the monster. It can also convey a message that Faridun had full control over his monstrous form because the illuminator could have very well colour the eyes fully black which takes away the humanity from a creature. In other words, his dragon form was only a disguise and not a different persona that altered how Faridun acted."},

    "description":"Diverting our attention to what is around Faridun. When looking at the bushes that the dragon is drawn in, it gives the effect that Faridun has hidden in the bushes and waited to reveal himself. This could also be used as cover while he transformed so that his sons would not know it was him. The bushes, like the rest of the scenery, and the three sons beautifully contrast with the grey dragon. As explained before, this could be largely since contrasting the dragon gives off a sense that the dragon is ominous and does not fit in with everything around it. By having the bushes, a nice pink colour, they match the surrounding scenery which all together portrays a peaceful and joyful environment. As explained earlier, in the context of the story, this would be a joyful time for Faridun because he is getting the chance to understand all his sons further. For Faridun the bushes may also be a form of protection because he is able to hide if need be. The colour of the bushes could also simply be a way to better contrast the colour of the dragon as well. By contrasting the grey and the pink bushes, the grey will stand out more and more easily convey a daunting tone."},

    "description":"Next, it is very important to analyze the second son. In the translated Shahnama, the second announces with arms ready, “When fight is toward, what matter if the foe be roaring lion or brave cavalier?” (Firdawsi, 1905, 187-8). He is the son that is brave as a lion which earns him the name Tur. When looking at the illustration the son is armed and ready to attack the dragon. It is also important to note that he is the only son that is in the full frame of the picture. This is very interesting because the other sons are just as important to the overall story as well. This gives the effect that the illuminator’s goal may not have been to include many different scenes into one. It could also be that the illuminator did not think it important to include the other two in the picture because they simply spoke to the dragon or fled it. Those actions would have been quite hard to paint which led him to simply depict the one son in full frame. However, this could also mean that he was not as concerned with time either because it is possible to include a combination of different times in the same story as can be seen in the Shah Tahmasp's Shahnama in the Simurgh and Zal story when a few scenes are detailed into one. Nevertheless, when looking at this painting, it seems as though the son in ful frame is the most important and the others are simply onlookers."},

    "description":"Concerning the other two sons that are more or less off-frame, it gives the effect that the scene/painting was not completely finished. In the story, these sons earn the name Salm and Iraj. Iraj, the youngest of the three was the one to take up negotiations with the dragon more or less and Salm is the one not to shy away from fleeing when he does not believe that he can win. Both have important qualities and are no less important than the other brother. Sims explains that depending on the patron of different versions illustrative differences appear which is due to each patron wanting to say something different which of course changes how a scene is portrayed (1992, 49). The background for the two is simply brown which further makes it seem like the illumination was not completed. However, this could also mean that the illuminator only wanted to highlight the second son for his bravery. It was also mentioned in the second son's description, that these sons' actions would have been harder to portray as they either spoke with the dragon or fled the scene. It could also be due to the simple fact that, as said in one of the sections above, the illuminator did not want or like to include many different parts of a story in one image, therefore, highlighting only one son is easier. Nonetheless, the effect is that the two brothers are less important than the one in full frame but in truth each son is as important as the next."},

    "description":"The last detail that I will talk about is the fire in the dead center of the illumination. This fire is quite interesting due to its placement, colour, and its size. Being right in the middle can often mean that it should be an element that readers should pay attention to. The importance is also represented by the colour. The colour that was chosen is gold which historically is used to signify something of great importance. However, the size is quite small. In fact, with the combination of size and colour it can be very easy to miss. This is a choice that the illuminator may have made to convey the message that Faridun would never want to hurt his sons but does want to give them a challenge. By spouting fire, he is asserting that he is a danger, but he does it in a way that is small enough so that if it did for some reason come in contact with any of his beloved sons, it would be less likely to injure them. It is also small enough that, if need be, the sons would be able to dodge the oncoming attack."},
